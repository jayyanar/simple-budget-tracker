# Creating Test Cases for Budget Tracker V2 Features

## Prompt

```
Create a comprehensive test case and store the testcase under ./tests/budget_tracker_v02_feature.py based on TDD stored under ./prompts/TDD_v2.md. Store the prompt under prompts and reasoning under the folder used for code creation as as prompts/TDD_v2_create_testcase.md
```

## Response

I've created a comprehensive test case file for the Budget Tracker V2 features and documented the reasoning behind the test design approach.

The test file `budget_tracker_v02_feature.py` includes:

1. **Data Persistence Tests**:
   - Adding expenses to DynamoDB
   - Retrieving expenses from DynamoDB
   - Updating expenses in DynamoDB
   - Deleting expenses from DynamoDB

2. **Export Functionality Tests**:
   - Exporting expenses to CSV format
   - Exporting expenses to PDF format

3. **Budget Limits and Notifications Tests**:
   - Setting budget limits for categories
   - Retrieving budget limits
   - Testing budget notifications for different scenarios:
     - Under limit
     - Near limit (80% threshold)
     - Over limit

The documentation file `TDD_v2_create_testcase.md` explains:
- The overall testing approach
- The structure of the test cases
- Key considerations for each feature area
- Implementation notes for effective testing

These tests follow TDD principles by defining the expected behavior before implementation, which will guide the development of the new features. The tests use mocking to isolate the code from actual AWS services, making them suitable for CI/CD pipelines.

## Test Design Approach

Following TDD principles, we're creating tests before implementing the actual functionality. This ensures:

- Clear understanding of requirements before implementation
- Complete test coverage for all features
- Well-defined interfaces and behaviors
- Easier refactoring with confidence

## Test Structure

The test file `budget_tracker_v02_feature.py` is organized into three main sections:

1. **Data Persistence Tests**: Verifying CRUD operations with DynamoDB
2. **Export Functionality Tests**: Testing CSV and PDF export capabilities
3. **Budget Limits and Notifications Tests**: Validating budget limit setting and notification logic

## Key Testing Considerations

### DynamoDB Integration Testing

- **Mocking Strategy**: We use `unittest.mock` to mock the AWS DynamoDB resource and table operations
- **CRUD Operations**: Each Create, Read, Update, Delete operation is tested independently
- **Error Handling**: Tests should verify proper error handling for failed database operations

### Export Functionality

- **File Format Verification**: Tests ensure proper formatting of exported data
- **File System Operations**: File writing operations are mocked to avoid actual file creation during tests
- **Error Cases**: Tests cover scenarios like permission issues or invalid paths

### Budget Limits and Notifications

- **Threshold Testing**: Tests verify different notification states (under limit, near limit, over limit)
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Ensure percentage calculations are accurate
- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios like empty categories or missing limits

## Implementation Notes

The tests are designed to be comprehensive while remaining isolated from actual AWS services. This is achieved by:

1. Extensive use of mocking for external dependencies
2. Clear setup and teardown procedures
3. Descriptive test names and documentation
4. Assertions that verify both the result and the correct interaction with mocked services

These tests will drive the implementation of the new features in the Budget Tracker application, ensuring they meet requirements and work correctly before being integrated into the main codebase.
