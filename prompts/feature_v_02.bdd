Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want secure access to my expense tracker
  So that my financial data remains confidential

  Scenario: User signs up for a new account
    Given I am on the signup page
    When I enter my email "user@example.com"
    And I create a password "SecurePass123"
    And I confirm my password "SecurePass123"
    And I click the "Sign Up" button
    Then I should receive a verification email

  Scenario: User logs in successfully
    Given I have an existing account
    When I enter my email "user@example.com"
    And I enter my password "SecurePass123"
    And I click the "Login" button
    Then I should see the dashboard

  Scenario: User fails login due to incorrect password
    Given I have an existing account
    When I enter my email "user@example.com"
    And I enter an incorrect password "WrongPass"
    And I click the "Login" button
    Then I should see an error message "Invalid username or password"

Feature: Data Persistence
  As a user
  I want my expense data stored persistently
  So that my data is securely saved and retrievable anytime

  Scenario: Expense data saved to DynamoDB
    Given I am logged in and add a new expense
    When I save the expense
    Then the expense details should be stored in DynamoDB

  Scenario: Retrieve stored expenses
    Given I have previously saved expenses
    When I log in and view my expense list
    Then I should see all my previously stored expenses

Feature: Data Export
  As a user
  I want to export my expenses
  So that I can analyze them externally

  Scenario: Export expenses to CSV
    Given I am viewing my expense summary
    When I click the "Export CSV" button
    Then a CSV file containing my expenses should be downloaded

  Scenario: Export expenses to PDF
    Given I am viewing my expense summary
    When I click the "Export PDF" button
    Then a PDF file containing my expenses should be downloaded
```
