# Green Code Implementation for Budget Tracker

## Prompt

Implement the BudgetTracker Python class based on provided tests ensuring all tests pass. Store the code under src/budget_tracker.py. All Tests created based on TDD are stored in tests/test_budget_tracker.py.

## Implementation Reasoning

The implementation of the BudgetTracker class was guided by the test-driven development (TDD) approach, where the tests defined the required functionality. Here's the reasoning behind key implementation decisions:

### 1. Class Structure

The implementation consists of two main classes:

- **Expense**: Represents individual expense entries with properties for amount, category, date, and description.
- **BudgetTracker**: Manages a collection of expenses and provides methods for adding, updating, deleting, and summarizing expenses.

This separation of concerns follows good object-oriented design principles, making the code more maintainable and easier to test.

### 2. Data Types and Validation

- **Decimal for monetary values**: Using Python's `Decimal` type for monetary values ensures precise calculations without floating-point errors.
- **Input validation**: The implementation includes validation for expense amounts and categories, raising appropriate error messages as specified in the tests.
- **UUID for expense IDs**: Each expense gets a unique identifier, making it easy to reference specific expenses for updates or deletions.

### 3. Filtering and Summarization

- **Date range filtering**: Methods like `get_expenses()`, `get_category_summary()`, and `get_total_expenses()` support optional date range filtering.
- **Category filtering**: The `get_expenses_by_category()` method allows retrieving all expenses in a specific category.
- **Summarization logic**: The `get_category_summary()` method aggregates expenses by category, calculating the total for each.

### 4. Data Export

- **CSV export**: The implementation includes methods for exporting expense data to CSV format, with extensibility for other formats in the future.

### 5. Error Handling

- **Descriptive error messages**: When validation fails, the code raises ValueError exceptions with clear, user-friendly messages.
- **Type conversion**: The code handles conversion between string and Decimal types for amounts, with appropriate error handling.

### 6. Design Patterns

- **Immutable data**: The implementation returns copies of expense lists rather than the internal list to prevent unintended modifications.
- **Optional parameters**: Many methods have optional parameters with sensible defaults, making the API flexible and easy to use.

## Test Coverage

The implementation satisfies all the test cases defined in `tests/test_budget_tracker.py`, including:

1. Adding expenses with validation
2. Editing existing expenses
3. Deleting expenses
4. Viewing expense summaries by category
5. Filtering expenses by date range
6. Exporting expense data
7. Viewing detailed breakdowns within categories

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation satisfies all the tests, potential future enhancements could include:

1. Persistence layer for storing expenses in a database
2. Support for recurring expenses
3. Budget setting and comparison against actual expenses
4. Additional export formats (e.g., JSON, PDF)
5. Data visualization capabilities
6. Multi-currency support

These enhancements would require additional tests and implementation work but would build upon the solid foundation established by the current code.
