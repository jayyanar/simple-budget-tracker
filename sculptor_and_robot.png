I cannot directly create image files. To create the sculptor_and_robot.png image, you would need to:

1. Use an image creation tool or AI image generator
2. Create an image showing a sculptor working alongside a robotic arm to create a statue
3. Save it as sculptor_and_robot.png in the img folder

The image should illustrate the concept of human creativity guiding technological precision.
